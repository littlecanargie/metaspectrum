# metaspectrum
This repository hosts R codes for meta-analysis spectrum methods under the structural equation modeling (SEM) ecosystem. SEM has been proven to be a useful tool for meta-analysis spectrum methods from its ability to specify complex, multivariate models with latent variables. Our code runs under the *R* environment and depends on [*OpenMx*](https://openmx.ssri.psu.edu/) to carryout the SEM specification and estimation procedures.  The estimation procedure is usually reasonably fast, but the construction of confidence intervals may take a some time since they're constructed using a likelihood-based approach in *OpenMx*. 

## Network meta-analysis

### nma()
- Standalone function for network meta-analysis under the SEM framework.
- This function permits several extensions to the Lu-Ades model that can be jointly applied 
    - Setting unequal degrees of heterogeneity for each treatment
    - Setting the heterogeneity as multiplicative on the error variance (unweighted least squares)
    - Setting the study effect as random effects
- For details and citation, please refer to [this 2019 RSM paper](https://doi.org/10.1002/jrsm.1344). The output confidence intervals can be a little wider than demonstrated in the paper since the paper presented Wald intervals instead of likelihood-based intervals.

### nma_side()
- Standalone function for side-splitting and symmetric side-splitting models for inconsistency in network meta-analysis.
- The architecture of the side-splitting model, which is a frequentist counterpart of the node-splitting model, can be found in [this 2010 SIM paper](https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.3767).
- The result of node(side)-splitting models may depend on an arbitrarily chosen reference treatment.  The symmetric side-splitting model was proposed to fix this asymmetry, which can be found in [this 2015 STATA journal paper](https://doi.org/10.1177/1536867X1501500403)
- For how these models are implemented under the SEM framework, please refer to [this 2019 RSM paper](https://doi.org/10.1002/jrsm.1344).

### nma_incon()
- Standalone function for evidence-splitting model, an approach to inconsistency in network meta-analysis that takes evidence structure into account.
- For citation and details (eg. why it provides more sensible results than previous models), please refer to [this 2021 RSM paper](https://doi.org/10.1002/jrsm.1480). The output confidence intervals can be a little wider than demonstrated in the paper since the paper presented Wald intervals instead of likelihood-based intervals.
